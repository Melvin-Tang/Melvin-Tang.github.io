               <h1>Freshman Year</h1><div class="freshman1"></div><h2>Hero's Journey Visual, May-June 2015.</h2><p class="dark">Explanation: This visual was a part of our final PBL in English freshman year. We had to track the journey of one of the heroes from a Greek myth. The project spanned several aspects, like a video, a physical visual representation, a presentation, and more.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: Looking back on it, I don't think I could have changed anything. It was truly flawless, perfect in every sense.  Those hours of work poured into paid off as it earned me and my group a perfect score. Although it was a grueling process, it was actually pretty fun. I'd do it all again if I had the same group members.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Excel Spreadsheet Creations, April 2015.</h2><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kdb7jvB0UnAy_6jLZwkurnlVL_2Hp4ZU6FRlU42P7vk/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" height="800" width="610"></iframe><p class="dark">Explanation: This assignment was for my Business Software Applications class freshman year.  The assignment was to use algorithims in Excel spreadsheets to create an interactive graphic. In my case, I made an interactive graphic that would show a Pokemon's evolution as you click on the green button.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I definitively could have improved on it. Parts of it didn't function properly and it just looked poorly overall. At the time, I didn't really understand Excel spreadsheets. I thought the process was long, redundant, and unecessary. I still think some parts of the assignment are unecessary. However, if I were to redo this assignment today, I would definitely do better on it.

This was a way to organize all the research me and my partner had gathered for my debate on Nuclear Weapons into a neat, concise order. Anybody who examined it would be able to quickly garner an idea of the topic, stance, and supporting details. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: It was as simple as can be. There were no mistakes in the work and everything was made as straight-forward as possible. There was nothing I could really change about it. An organization of notes should be should be concise and straight-forward. Pack as much information as you can with the least amount of words.

Our assignment was to find a book and analyze the cover/opening summary of the book to see if influenced our decision to read it or not. If it did, provide constructive criticism as to where they could change it to entice the reader to read the book.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: The assignment seemed tedious at the time. Looking back, I wish my assignments were that easy now. If I had to do this assignment again, I'd pick different books. All the books I used in the assignment I had read before, giving me prior knowledge and thus a slight adventage when doing the assignment. 
               
               <h2>Allele Frequency Project, February 2015.</h2><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vtVXuYIPA_RK7iKcsLwGcAAGbBkQbnSAtinawkW-Ezc/pub?embedded=true" height="750" width="610"></iframe><p class="dark">Explanation: This assignment was for my Biology class freshman year. Our assignment was to conduct research and survey the school population for a certain genetic trait. Our chosen genetic trait was whether people clasped their right hand over their left or vice versa. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I'd say the experiment and survey was a success, with the data proving our hypothesis correct. Doing the experiment again with a larger survey group will certainly help with the data. Following the directions, we were able to achieve our desired results. I don't see why I would do this again unless there were extra variables added.
               
               <h2>Self Portrait, December-January 2015.</h2><img src="images/selfportrait.PNG"><p class="dark">Explanation: This assignment was for my Graphic design class. We were to create a self-portrait of ourselves using Adobe Illustrator. This served as our primary lesson and application of the use of the pen tool.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: Looking back, I really don't like how it looks and I personally think that I could make a better one now as I have more skills. It took about a month to make this first one and at the time, I was proud of my work because I was sadly assigned to the computer that kept crashing.

We were going over the topic of the Holocaust through reading the book "Night", by Elie Wiesel. Within the book, they are various themes and our assignment was to find a song that correlates with one of the themes contained in the book.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I feel that this assignment was a success and I achieved my desired goal. If I had to do this again, I'd pick a different theme from the book and a different song to correlate with said different theme. However, many of themes that come from the book have negative connotations. Thus, sad/negative songs have a greater chance of being associated with the sad themes.
               </p>
               
               <h2>First Web Portfolio, Fall 2015.</h2><img src="images/first.000.portfolio.jpg"><p class="dark">Explanation: This was the beginning of my coding experience at Southwest CTA. We began coding our first portfolios in the Fall of 2015 under the guidance of Ms. Chang. It was a basic portfolio that outlined what we did in our unit lessons.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I cringe looking back at this screenshot and realize how far I've come since those days. My skills have exponentionally grown so much since then. If I had my current skills back then I would be able to create a superior site. In the past, I didn't really understand coding, but I understand it a little bit more now.
               
               <h2>Pearls of Wisdom, January 2016.</h2><embed src="images/pearls-of-wisdom.pdf" height="750" width="610"><p class="dark">Explanation: This was an assignment for my English class. We were learning about symbolism, in particular, wisdom. The assignment was meant to showcase various pieces of advice from people/things that influence you.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I realize that I should've added more, but I think the way that I created it is good. I like the flow of it, but I think a bit more content in terms of actual quotes/advice would've shone more than the design. 
               
               <h2>Anne Frank Essay, March 2016</h2><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdYV6UVUoHJ3bxj835xBGr7CJjJ2wJvpld1qp9voC-8/pub?embedded=true" height="750" width="610"></iframe><p class="dark">Explanation: This was an assignment for my English class. We were learning about the Holocaust through the lens of "The Diary of Anne Frank". We were to use the book and its themes to assert our claim of whether people are inherently good or evil.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: The assignment went well and I don't think I could've explained the things that I put into my essay in any further detail. Perhaps if there was additional content, there would be something to change. There's always room for improvement.
               
               <h2>Underage Drinking PSA, Fall 2015.</h2><video width="610" height="420" controls><source src="images/antidrinking.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="dark">Explanation: This was an assignment for my Web Design class. Our job was to create a PSA against underage drinking and illustrate what would happen if you partake in underage drinking. It tied into web design as it would show us how to link/embed a video.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: We learned our lesson on how to embed a video and had a little bit of fun learning it. The video could've been longer and more in-depth, but we were constrained to only 30 seconds. The video's audio quality was shoddy. Some parts had a little bit of shaky camera. My group and I should've made the video more professional looking, but it got the job done.
               
               <h2>Spanish Website Banner Ad Animations, Spring 2016.</h2><video width="610" height="420" controls><source src="images/animation.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="dark">Explanation: This was an assignment for my Graphic Design class. The assignment was part of a collaborative project for my Graphic Design and Web Design classes. We had to make a website that featured a Spanish-speaking country. The animations are suppossed to be banner ads that would line the edge of the site. Strangly, we started the ads first, instead of together at the same time. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: From this assignment, we learned integral lessons about HTML and CSS. We learned how to use CSS proficently to be able to make our designs come to life. HTML allowed us to place our content. We also learned how to use Adobe Flash, which we used to make our banner ads work. To create our banner ads, it required work in Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, which we used to create the character. Flash was a major pain but I think it was worth it in the end; we gained a valuable new skill.</p>

We were discussing the Gilded Age and it's impact on American society. The major twist was that all of us had to connect our chosen topics with the topic that preceded it. In the end, it would form one big cohesive story/timeline. My chosen topic was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In the narrative, it follows the story of two Chinese immigrants and their lives as they move through the West Coast.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I think I did very well on this narrative. I included historical facts through the use of footnotes and wrote a very riveting story. However, I agree that the ended was lacking and anti-climactic. The reason for this was that I was rushed to meet the 12:00 AM duedate. If I had more time, I definitely would've been able to create a more fleshed out story.

Our assignment was to create a functional app and present it to elementary and middle schoolers. Our app is suppossed to be a excercise tracker, helping you track your workouts. It acts a list that you can check off of. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: On the surface, our app looked very simple and it was. My group decided to not worry so much about form, but to focus on function. Our app was fully functional, but it looked relatively bare to a normal user. We used MIT App Inventor to help us create the app. Something I would definitely change would be a more balanced approach towards design and function. Presenting to elemntary schoolers and middle schoolers was quite the change in pace, but I liked it. I'd do it all again.

Instead of having an test at the end of the unit, our teacher decided to switch it up and tell us to create a presentation that basically composed of the major concepts that we learned. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: I did a decent job on the assignment, but I was weak in some areas. I missed a few easy points by forgetting to put certain things down. If I had to do it all again, I'd start working on it earlier because I felt really rushed trying to finish it.

               <br>
               
               Reflection: My partner and I did better than I expected and I we recieved an overall A grade. The only part I felt was lacking was the actual presentation. I kind of stumbled on my words in certain parts, but I recovered. However, I don't think I had enough content because I felt that I was repeating the same things over but with different words and phrases.

It's part of ongoing school year-long project under the guise of a design company. We had to create a fake design company and every project done in class will be considered a part of the fake design company. This showcases the creation of the company's logo from various members of the group, including myself.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: One design won out in the end and I can see why it won. It was clean, modern, and just felt right. The gut feeling told me it was a good design. My own design could've used some work. It was highly abstract and the ordinary viewer passing by might not totally get the tone our company was trying to set.

Our task was to create an app for the Congressional App Challenge. Our app was designed to be a tutoring app geared for students with peer-to-peer tutoring as its main focus. It would allow you to schedule sessions and required Infinite Campus integration. This video was used to display our app as bare-bones as it could get and to provide the judges with the general idea of what we were going for. 
               <br>
               <br>
               
               Reflection: Personally, I think our idea was good, but perhaps our execution wasn't quite there yet. We spent many hours designing it in Illustrator and then putting it through MIT App Inventor to create a very simple version of our app. If we had better coding knowledge, we would'v been able to create a better product.

               <br>
               
               Reflection: I personally believe I did good for my very first PHP website/database. This project deepened my knowledge of web design as I had a new aspect of code to work with. I will definitely consider using this in the future if there is a lot of content to organize and display.

               <br>
               
               Reflection: The project was a long process and required plenty of creativity. The project was intended to give a real taste of the graphic design industry to us students. Personally, I felt my work could've been better at some portions.
